## Nathan Shammah, RIKEN

### Open-source for quantum technologies

### Talk
In past decades there has been considerable advancement both in theory and in experiments in research laboratories around the world. More recently, there has been an increased effort toward spinning out technology from our scientific understanding of quantum theory. The software stack interfacing with these early prototypes of quantum machines is heavily relying on the open-source paradigm. Nathan will review software and hardware trends, and give an intro to quantum information processing. He’ll speak about the quantum toolbox in Python (QuTiP), general community efforts aimed at creating a sustainable ecosystem for open-source projects and provide some examples of how QC and ML are beginning to interact with each other.

### Speaker Bio
Nathan Shammah is a Postdoctoral Research Scientist at RIKEN, Japan’s national lab, in the Quantum Physics Theory Lab, where he investigates the dynamics of open quantum systems. Lead developer of QuTiP, the quantum toolbox in Python, he also writes the quantum tech newsletter.

### Talk
Crowd-sourced steering does not sound as appealing as automated driving. We need to go beyond supervised learning for automated driving, including for computer vision problems seeing great progress with strong supervision today. First, we will motivate why this is required for long-term large-scale autonomous robots. Second, we will discuss recent state-of-the-art results obtained in the ML team at Toyota Research Institute (TRI) for unsupervised domain adaptation from simulation and self-supervised depth and pose prediction from monocular imagery. Finally, I will talk about how we actually scale to large datasets using our cloud infrastructure and distributed deep learning.
