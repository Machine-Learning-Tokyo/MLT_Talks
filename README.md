## Nathan Shammah (RIKEN)

### Open-source for quantum technologies

### Talk
In past decades there has been considerable advancement both in theory and in experiments in research laboratories around the world. More recently, there has been an increased effort toward spinning out technology from our scientific understanding of quantum theory. The software stack interfacing with these early prototypes of quantum machines is heavily relying on the open-source paradigm. Nathan will review software and hardware trends, and give an intro to quantum information processing. He’ll speak about the quantum toolbox in Python (QuTiP), general community efforts aimed at creating a sustainable ecosystem for open-source projects and provide some examples of how QC and ML are beginning to interact with each other.

### Speaker Bio

Second, we will discuss recent state-of-the-art results obtained in the ML team at Toyota Research Institute (TRI) for unsupervised domain adaptation from simulation and self-supervised depth and pose prediction from monocular imagery. Finally, I will talk about how we actually scale to large datasets using our cloud infrastructure and distributed deep learning.
